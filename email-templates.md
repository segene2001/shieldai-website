✅ Use AI safely with patient data
✅ Full PHIPA & PIPEDA compliance
✅ Data stays in Canada
✅ Complete audit trail
✅ Live in 24 hours

Can I show you a 15-minute demo this week?

## 5. Follow-Up Email (Day 3)

**Subject:** Re: [Original Subject]

Hi [Name],

Following up on my email from [Day].

I understand you're busy, so I'll be brief:

**3 reasons to consider ShieldAI:**

1. **Compliance Risk:** Using AI without proper safeguards = potential $100K+ fines
2. **Competitive Disadvantage:** Your competitors are using AI safely (with us)
3. **ROI:** $380K savings vs. building in-house

**Quick question:** Are you the right person to discuss AI compliance, or should I connect with someone else?
